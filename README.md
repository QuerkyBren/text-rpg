### text-rpg
This terminal-based text game uses text files to load maps and features four bosses to defeat with interactive objects found throughout the map in-game. You can view gameplay on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/xyogtUPnj90). The game is far from complete as it has many attributes - some complete, some far from complete.
