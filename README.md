The Text Realm - A complex text-based RPG game in C++
A preview for this game can be seen at https://youtu.be/xyogtUPnj90
The game incorporates an event log, stats for each character class,
monster battles, looting, dungeons, and text-file generated maps
and messages.  The game is far from complete as it has many
complex attributes - some complete, some far from complete.
The game features a core storyline of four bosses to be conquered.
