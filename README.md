# TextRealm
This terminal-based text game uses text files to load maps and features four bosses to defeat with interactive objects found throughout the map in-game. (Beginner C++ Project)<br>

<br>The game incorporates an event log, stats for each character class,<br>
monster battles, looting, dungeons, and text-file generated maps<br>
and messages.  The game is far from complete as it has many<br>
complex attributes - some complete, some far from complete.<br>
The game features a core storyline of four bosses to be conquered.<br>

The code is indented with 4 spaces.<br>
A lot of the game can be vastly improved.<br>
There are also many incomplete attributes that<br>
are yet to be implemented properly.<br>
This was written when I was fairly new to C++; you have been warned!<br>
